# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project explores data from the Titanic disaster to predict passenger survival using various machine learning algorithms. It includes preprocessing steps, feature engineering, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Datasets

- `titanic_train.csv`
- `titanic_test.csv`

The dataset contains features like passenger class, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, fare, port of embarkation, and the survival label.

## Project Structure

- **Data Exploration**: Initial visualization and analysis to understand key patterns.
- **Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling, and feature selection.
- **Modeling**: Training multiple classifiers including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Tree
  - SVM
  - Naive Bayes
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, and cross-validation used to compare model performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- plotly
